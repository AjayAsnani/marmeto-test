# Tab Switching Product Display

This project demonstrates a tab switching layout for displaying products categorized under "Men," "Women," and "Kids." The product cards dynamically fetch data from an API response, including product image, badge, title, vendor, price, and compare at price. Additionally, the discount percentage is calculated using JavaScript. Although the "Add to Cart" button is non-functional, it serves as a visual representation.

  - Mobile Screen: Up to 767px
